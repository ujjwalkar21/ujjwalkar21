# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ujjwal Kar  

Welcome to my GitHub!  

- This account reflects my early journey in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, which began during my **B.Tech** in **Computer Science and Engineering**.  
- During my early college years, I was really curious about how computers can think and make decisions like humans. 
- I explored Python, data analysis, and ML model building â€” experiences that shaped my curiosity about how data drives decisions.  
- Since graduation, Iâ€™ve been working as a **Full Stack Developer**, building scalable and efficient web applications.  

Although my current focus is in **Full Stack Development**, this space (`@ujjwalkar21`) preserves my foundation in Data Science and early explorations in ML.
