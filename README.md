# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ujjwal Kar  

Welcome to my GitHub!  
This account reflects my early journey in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, which began during my B.Tech in Computer Science at **Bengal Institute of Technology (2019â€“2023)**.  

I explored Python, data analysis, and ML model building â€” experiences that shaped my curiosity about how data drives decisions.  
Since graduation, Iâ€™ve been working as a **Full Stack Developer**, building scalable and efficient web applications.  

Although my current focus is in **Full Stack Development**, this space (`@ujjwalkar21`) preserves my foundation in Data Science and early explorations in ML.
