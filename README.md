# 👋 Hi, I'm Ujjwal Kar

Welcome to my GitHub!  
This account (`@ujjwalkar21`) represents the **beginning of my journey in technology** — where I explored **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and the exciting world of data-driven problem solving.

## 🧠 My Early Journey (2019–2022)

In 2019, I began my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** at **Bengal Institute of Technology**.  
During my early college years, I was deeply curious about how data can tell stories and make intelligent decisions.  
I invested my time in learning and building projects around:

- Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Machine Learning model training & evaluation  
- Data visualization and insights generation

In my final year, I also completed a **Data Science internship**, which gave me practical exposure to real-world datasets and problem-solving.

## 💻 Transition to Full Stack Development

After graduation, I realized that the software world excited me just as much as data — especially **building complete, scalable web applications**.  
Since then, I’ve been working as a **Full Stack Developer** for 2+ years, focusing on:

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools & Practices:** Git, CI/CD, Cloud deployment
